Comparison of five Scottish universities in 2018-2019 using data from HESA 

Using data freely available via The Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) at https://www.hesa.ac.uk/data-and-analysis, for 2018/19 academic year, I have produced a report showing how the University of Edinburgh compares with the University of Aberdeen, the University of Glasgow, the University of Strathclyde and the University of St Andrews on the following metrics:

* Number of Undergraduate and Postgraduate Taught students
* The ratio of students to staff (‘SSR’)
* Income to University per academic staff member
